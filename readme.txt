This is my prototype of the Polito's Pizza website.

Some important info to save you from grading.
It does use javascript (Order screen, order confirmation and password box). 
It is not fully mobile reponsive.
It is not html validated. I ran out of time to fix errors.
It IS css validated.
The ordering system is not 100% functional as I use Ajax to send the order to the server and sometimes the server doesn't get the request.
